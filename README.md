## Description

Qolify is a Fabric mod created with the idea that you shouldn't need to download 37 QOL mods just to have all those nice features. Why not pack them all into one mod?

Right now qolify is in its infancy and doesn't have many features, but that should change over time

## Features
- Smooth zoom with scrolling (Configurable keybind)
- Hotkey labels (Displays your keybinding on each hotbar slot)
- Fullbright (With keybind toggle)
- Status effect timers
- Modmenu compatibility
- Move chat above armor bar

## Planned Features
- Item stitching fix
- Food value info (In tooltips and on food names)
- Accurate sheared sheep colors
- Shulker box tooltips
- Enchantment descriptions
- Keybind modifiers (Such as CTRL+F, etc.)
- Coordinate directions
- Connected textures
- Banners don't lose resolution when on shields
- Whatever is popular request!
